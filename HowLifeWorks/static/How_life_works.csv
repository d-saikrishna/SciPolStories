,"Our cells are programmed by genes to assemble into tissues and organs.....Interpreted in modern terms, Mendel’s observations on patterns of inheritance imply that the trait- determining genes come in different varieties, called alleles. For each gene, you get one allele from your father and one from your mother. (They each have two, and which one you get is determined at random.) The maternal and paternal alleles may or may not be the same; if they differ, each may give rise to different versions of the respective trait.......some traits are, on the contrary, blended when inherited from parents. But of course that often the case, for example with skin pigmentation is or height. Some traits do seem to be inherited discretely— eye and hair color are often cited as typical examples, although the truth is more complicated— while others appear to vary continuously....From the 1910s, the British scientists Ronald Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane and others developed mathematical models of how different alleles spread through a population under the influence of Darwinian natural selection, which favors alleles associated with traits that give individuals an adaptive advantage. Using statistical reasoning, which Fisher pioneered, these models were able to handle traits influenced by more than one gene, some of which might manifest as graduated rather than discrete variations. This work reconciled the discrete inheritance of traits apparently demanded by Mendel’s results with the blending seemingly implied by Darwin’s theory....Imagine an ideal situation in which two individuals have fully sequenced genomes that are identical except for just one difference in a specific gene—say, Alice, one of our almost-identical twins, has allele 1, and the other, Amy, has allele 2, which has a single difference in one base pair of the corresponding section of DNA. Say now that they also have identical traits and appearance, except for one detail: Alice has blue eyes, Amy’s are green. Let’s say we’ve established that eye color is strongly inherited: it seems to be mostly a matter of genes. It seems reasonable then to assume that the genetic difference is the cause of the phenotypic difference.",Dogma,Gene and genome,gen,GG3,DNA,Phenotype,,,Gene and genome,1
,"But in fact there never was a proper reconciliation of the “evolutionary gene” that mediates inheritance and the molecular gene that acts somehow in cells to shape an organism through development.

,"In an informal note in 1956, Crick came up with what he called the “Central Dogma” of biology, which specifies the direction in which information is transferred from molecule to molecule in protein synthesis: it goes from DNA to the intermediary RNA, and from RNA to protein. To “play safe,” Crick allowed for the possibility that information might somehow go back from RNA to DNA, and perhaps directly from DNA to protein, even though there was then no evidence of either process. But once the information was in the protein, it could never flow back to DNA or RNA, or indeed laterally from one protein to another.",Dogma,DNA,DNA,CDG1,Phenotype,Other,,,DNA,1
,"There are just four types of DNA base, but twenty amino acids in naturally occurring proteins, so it takes more than one base to encode each amino acid uniquely. Indeed, we can deduce purely on mathematical grounds that you need at least three bases per amino acid, because there are 4 × 4 = 16 permutations of pairs of the four bases— not enough to encode each amino acid uniquely— but 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 distinct triplets. This gives rather more different triplets than is needed for this “genetic code,” but maybe some triplets are ignored or used as alternative ways of encoding the same amino acid?....As David Baltimore put it in 1984, “The cell’s brain had been found to be a tape reader scanning an array of information encoded as a linear sequence, that is ultimately translated into three- dimensional proteins.” This, it seemed, is how life works....Later in 1961 Crick wrote a paper outlining the key principles of the genetic code. It is, he said, a triplet code that is read out linearly from a fixed starting point, and is degenerate, meaning that each amino acid might correspond to more than one base triplet (or codon). The race then began to crack the full code linking base-pair triplets to amino acids, a project completed in 1967. The task was more challenging than some had expected, partly because not all of the codons encode amino acids. Three are instead instructions to stop the enzyme RNA polymerase from reading the DNA sequence, signaling the end of a gene.",Dogma,DNA,DNA,CD4,DNA,Protein,,,DNA,1

,"There are in fact two types of chromatin in the nucleus while a cell is not dividing and its chromosomes remain unpacked. The most abundant form is called euchromatin, and it is relatively open, a bit like a polymer gel. The other form, heterochromatin, is more compact, with a density comparable to that of the X- shaped chromosomes during cell division, and is confined to a few small patches. It’s tempting to suppose that euchromatin is “active” DNA, which is loose enough to let the transcription apparatus get to work on it, whereas heterochromatin is compressed for storage, like a big data file. But it’s not so simple, sadly: even chromosomes containing a large amount of dense heterochromatin can be transcriptionally active, for example.",un-dogma,Chromatin,Chr,CHR1,DNA,Protein,Chromatin structure,,DNA,2
,"If all of this complexity destroys the pretty illusion created by the iconic double helix as a transparent repository of genetic information, it also opens up a much richer panorama. The fundamental mechanism of information storage and transfer in nucleic acids— complementary base pairing— is so elegant that it risks blinding us to the awesome sophistication of the full process of getting that information in and out, let alone what it actually means. The molecules do not simply wander up to one another and start talking.

,"For example, genes on DNA are accompanied by sequences near (and “upstream” of, in terms of the direction of readout) their start, typically a hundred to a thousand base pairs long, called promoter sites. Particular proteins must bind to these regions in order for transcription by RNA polymerase to begin. Several different molecules, especially proteins called transcription factors, are involved in this initiation process. What happens at a promoter site deter mines whether transcription happen; but the chance that it can will is influenced by DNA sequences called enhancers, of which there are hundreds of thousands in the human genome, typically fifty to fifteen hundred base pairs long. Perplexingly, enhancers may sit a long way away from the gene they influence— perhaps as many as a million base pairs or so. What’s more, genes don’t necessarily have their own dedicated enhancers; some may share enhancers and thus may be co- regulated, even if the genes themselves lie very far apart along a particular chromosome.",un-dogma,Enhancer,Enc,Enc2,Transcription,DNA,non-linear DNA interactions,,DNA,2
,"In this way, gene duplication is thought to be a source of evolutionary innovation, making new kinds of behavior or organism possible. There are many known examples where gene duplication is adaptive, such that it seems to be selected for in organisms exposed to stresses such as heat, cold, or high concentrations of salts or toxic metals. Of course, such duplications don’t happen in order for that innovation to occur; they are likely to be random in themselves. A harder question to answer (for which there is not yet any consensus) is whether, because of its potential benefits, some degree of gene duplication is actively permitted, rather than simply slipping past the cell’s mechanisms for ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication....As well as the complication of gene duplication, the picture of an orderly, linear arrangement of genes along DNA is undermined by the fact that some genes can overlap: the same bit of DNA can encode more than one RNA transcript. Such overlaps are particularly common in viruses and bacteria, where the genomes are very compact and space- efficient— but they are found in the human genome too. Overlapping genes cannot therefore be equated with unique and exclusive DNA sequences.",un-dogma,Gene and genome,gen,EN8,DNA,DNA,gene duplication,,Gene and genome,1

,"Let me just point out here how these textbook examples, like hair color or the features of Mendel’s peas, tend to be literally superficial characteristics, which differ just in visual appearance. In other words, they tend to ask “What are the genetics that make one person’s eyes look different from another’s?,” rather than “What are the genes that shape eyes, or bodies?” That would be a much more complex, and for that reason more revealing, question about “what genes do.”....Many traits are not simply this or that—blueb eyes or green—but are differences of degree: how tall are they, how do they score in IQ tests, what are their risks of heart disease? Then we might ask how much the spread in height difference, technically called the variance, can be statistically correlated with differences in genetics. We don’t need to know anything at the outset about which genes to look at to “explain” such variance. Indeed, the whole point of an analysis like this is that we don’t know which genes matter. By making comparisons of the entire genome sequences of the individuals, we can find which genes seem to “make a difference” and which don’t. To state it more precisely, we are looking here for correlations between variations in genes and in traits, but we can’t be sure that this means the genes “make” the difference.....Robert Plomin has asserted, for example, that make in terms of personality and traits, genes are what really matter: for intelligence (as measured by IQ or academic attainment), say, parents “matter, but they don’t make a difference.” At face value this is simply an unintelligible claim— how can something matter if it doesn’t make a difference? But Plomin is using “difference” in a very specific way. He means that only the genetic component of variance in intelligence (over a large sample of individuals) can be systematically interpreted: variations in genes are correlated with these these variations in cognitive ability.......a gene-centric view of life demands a targeted misattribution of agency. Notice too that even the genetic component of a complex trait like intelligence relates to statistical variance. It is not deterministic, but probabilistic. This is generally the case for polygenic traits: the genetic influence is visible on average, but it can’t predict individual cases. One might be able to say, for example, that a baby with a particular profile of the genes identified in a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as being correlated with IQ16 has a 45 percent chance of being in the top 20 percent of school achievers. In a case like that, this is probably pretty much as good a prediction as you’ll ever get from genes alone.",un-dogma,Gene and genome,gen,GE4,DNA,Phenotype,DNA is not all that,,Gene and genome,1

There are no isolable “intelligence genes.” If we select embryos for highly polygenic traits like this, we will have little idea for what else we might be selecting....Even for traits that show a strong heritability, such as height, the genetic component derives from the tiny effects of many genes rather than big effects from just a few.

,"Pritchard and colleagues suggest that most diseases are directly affected by only a relatively small number of genes, and that these tend to be involved in cell processes that are important for how the disease manifests....The omnigenic model has implications for evolution too. Natural selection doesn’t work directly on genes, but rather, on the organisms that carry them....This “omnigenic” model means that some genes can have a significant role in the development of a trait or disease while accounting for only a tiny part of the heritability or indeed the risk of that condition....Instead, the “global” activity of the genome sets the state of a cell or tissue such that it is at greater or lesser risk of the disease developing. This complexity of dynamic interactions throughout the genome, along with the ambiguity of what a gene even as a meaningful functional unit, suggests that perhaps we is should really be trying to understand inheritance not on the basis of genes but of what is really passed to offspring: their entire genome....For such reasons alone, a genome sequence can never “fully specify the organism”: how it will grow, how it will look, how it will behave— or in short, how it works.",un-dogma,Gene and genome,gen,OG1,DNA,Phenotype,omnigenic,,Gene and genome,1

,"X- chromosome inactivation was discovered in 1961 by the British geneticist Mary Lyon, and is sometimes called Lyonization. Lyon’s studies of the process led her to a conclusion which seemed so counterintuitive that it was dismissed with condescension by some of her male colleagues. She proposed that each cell in the female body decides at random which of the two X chromosomes— one maternal, one paternal— to turn off. That Lyon was correct is demonstrated in dramatic fashion in tortoiseshell cats, which may have orange or black hairs (and in calico cats, white too) depending on the state of pigment- producing cells called melanocytes. Any melanocyte might or might not, in principle, produce the black pigment, depending on which variant of the pigment-producing gene it carries. This gene is located on the X chromosome.For males, then, the hair is genetically disposed to be all black or all orange, depending on which allele is on its sole X chromosome.But if female cats carry both alleles, one on each X, then random X inactivation throughout the body early in development produces a mosaic of cells producing different pigmentation—which creates, in the growing fetal kitten, patches of cells that give rise to one color or the other, producing a mottled coloration. This means that generally only females can be tortoiseshells....the pigmentation pattern is determined at random, not genetically.",un-dogma,lncRNA,lnc_R,LNC2,DNA,Phenotype,Chromatin Structure,Random phenotype,RNA,2
,"In the 1990s it was found that X inactivation is controlled by a gene called Xist (for X-inactivation-specific transcript), which is expressed only on the X chromosome that will become inactive. The odd thing was that it didn’t seem possible to find the protein Xist encoded—which turned out to be because such a thing doesn’t exist. Rather, it is the RNA transcript of Xist that directly produces inactivation. The Xist RNA molecule became only the second known example of a functional long noncoding (lnc) RNA (“Long” here means more than about two hundred nucleotides; there are also many shorter “small” ncRNA molecules.) Xist ncRNA works by binding to the DNA of the X chromosome that expresses it; the RNA transcripts appear to spread over and coat more or less the entire chromosome. There the RNA molecules help to induce chromosomal changes that persist even in their absence....Another well-studied lncRNA, called Airn, is involved in the phenomenon called imprinting, in which a maternal or paternal allele is silenced during early growth of the embryo and placenta. This happens to only some of our genes; fewer than one hundred imprinted genes have been found in humans. The Airn lncRNA silences(imprints) a gene called Igf2r, the protein product of which otherwise interacts with and disrupts another protein that boosts embryo growth. In other words, Airn seems to regulate genes in double-negative fashion, inhibiting an inhibitor. It is generally the paternal version of Igf2r that gets imprinted, and the Airn RNA does this by interfering with Igf2r transcription as a kind of distracting decoy. The DNA encoding Airn overlaps with the promoter region for Igf2r, so that if Airn is being transcribed, the RNA polymerase enzyme is too busy to get to work on Igf2r. The odd thing here is that it’s not the lncRNA molecule itself that matters, so much as the distracting effect of making it—an effect called transcriptional interference....This is actually a rather common situation in gene regulation by long ncRNAs: the actual product of the transcription is irrelevant, it’s the production process itself that counts....Take the way ncRNA modulates expression of a gene called Bend4. This gene is regulated by a promoter site called Bendr, which itself gets transcribed into a ncRNA. Again it seems the point is not that this RNA molecule “does” anything in itself, but rather, that its transcription somehow turns on a piece of DNA within Bendr that enhances the transcription of Bend4. The ncRNA is a mere signal that this activation has taken place: its production is a kind of lure for switching on the enhancer hidden within the corresponding DNA.",un-dogma,lncRNA,lnc_R,LNC3,RNA,Transcription,Gene regulation,,RNA,2
,"One estimate suggests that around 60 percent of our genes are regulated by microRNAs. Some of these little molecules bind directly to the chromosomes and stop sections of DNA being transcribed, or alternatively turn on transcription. Some of them prevent the translation of a gene’s mRNA product into the corresponding protein by interacting with the mRNA in some way, perhaps labeling it for enzymatic destruction....Not all regulatory ncRNAs are long; some are surprisingly small. The first to be discovered, in 1993 by developmental biologist Victor Ambros and his colleagues, was just twenty-two nucleotides long. The researchers found it while studying genes called lin-4 and lin-14 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans; these genes have a key role in the organism’s development. Lin-4 seemed to downregulate lin-14; the researchers wanted to find out how, and they imagined that this involved the protein that lin-encoded. They discovered that not only is lin-4 tiny—much smaller than normal genes, and in fact “ridiculously small” in the researchers’ own estimation—but it didn’t make a protein at all. Rather, it encoded a mere scrap of ncRNA: the first so-called microRNA....Regulation of mRNA by microRNAs happens promiscuously. A given microRNA might target many (typically more than a hundred) mRNAs, and many different microRNAs might target a specific mRNA....Two of the genes that are central to maintaining stem cells in a pluripotent state are called Oct4 and Sox2. If Oct4 expression is turned off in a stem cell, the cell is apt to differentiate: to develop into a lineage of a particular tissue type. These two genes seem to activate the expression of a family of microRNAs called the Let- 7 family. In other words, the genes are in a sense just switches for making microRNAs, which themselves then determine if a cell will differentiate or not.

A second common means of regulating transcription places chemical markers not on the double helix itself but on the histone proteins around which it is wound in the chromosomes. Those markers include methyl groups, but also a variety of other chemical groups with names like phosphoryl, acetyl, and ubiquitinyl. Some of these histone modifications may have quite specific effects. For example, if three methyl groups are added at a particular site on the histone protein denoted H3 at the sites where the histones package a gene promoter region, transcription of the gene gets switched on. This is probably because the histone modification has knock- on effects that loosen up the chromatin so that the transcription enzymes can access it, as if the attachment of methyl groups has undone a clasp.

Some of the amino acids— called “residues” when linked into a polypeptide— contain chemical groups that can form the weak chemical bonds called hydrogen bonds, the same linkages that zip together the DNA double helix. Some residues contain the “donor” half of such a bond: a hydrogen atom with a slight positive charge.... Besides hydrogen bonding, the other main driving force behind protein folding is the different solubilities of the various amino acids in the water that fills the cell. Some amino acids contain chemical groups that won’t readily dissolve in water. You might say that they are “oily,” or in technical terms, hydrophobic (“water- fearing”). Others can interact favorably with water molecules, for example by forming hydrogen bonds with them, and these are said to be hydrophilic (“water- loving”).

It’s clearly possible for many different parts of a chain several hundred residues long to feel some attraction to one another: the chain could fold in many plausible ways. Only one of these these is likely to have the lowest energy possible—and that is the protein’s folding target, called the native fold. But to find it, you’d imagine that the folding chain would have to try out lots of other alternatives.Its lowest-energy folded conformation (the technical word for the particular way the chain is crumpled) may well be “programmed” into the amino acid sequence, but the chain doesn’t “know” that this is its intended destination. It has to find its way there by trial and error. We can think of the possible chain conformations as populating a kind of energy landscape, in which those conformations that are relatively stable appear as dips and valleys.

In 2022 the AlphaFold team trained the algorithm using a subset of the 170,000 or so known protein structures, and used it to predict the structures of others from just their sequences.

,"Many proteins acquire chemical modifications before they can do their job. In other words, other enzymes stitch onto the folded chain chemical groups that are not made from amino acids at all. Some of these added groups contain metal ions such as iron, copper, or cobalt, which are good at facilitating chemical reactions. The hemoglobin protein, for example, has at its core a heme group in which an iron atom sits at the center of a ring made from carbon and nitrogen atoms. The iron can form a chemical bond with oxygen so that hemoglobin can ferry it around the bloodstream and bring it to where it can be used to “burn” sugars and generate energy....Another common chemical addition to the polypeptide chain are sugar molecules, typically themselves linked into short chains....Protein kinases are a fairly large family of proteins. There are around five hundred of them in human cells, encoded by around 2 percent of our protein- coding genes. And almost half of our proteins are capable of being phosphorylated, some of them at several different sites that might be accessed by different protein kinases. So this isn’t just a matter of a phosphorylated protein being “on” or “off.” They can be activated by degrees, and in a cooperative manner: some kinases might only attach their phosphate to target proteins that already have other phosphates attached. This means that such signal transduction pathways can have a rather complex logic. What’s more, there are other enzymes called phosphatases whose job is to chop a phosphate group back off another protein. In this way, protein kinases and phosphatases can regulate the activity of other enzymes in a cyclic fashion....A protein kinase takes a phosphate ion from the cell’s “energy molecule” ATP and attaches it to another protein, most commonly one of two amino acids (serine or threonine) in the polypeptide chain of its target.

This is generally thought to be due to a shape change in the protein: the docking of B might, say, pull open an active site that then sets to work to convert A to P....GPCRs were regarded as simple on- off switches, activated by an allosteric change in conformation...But there is another reason why many of our proteins are not machine- like locks that fit specific keys— and why therefore the allosteric interactions that create networks of interaction and control can’t be understood in terms of precise, mechanical switching.

For example, many enzymes have loops in the polypeptide chain that dangle around or over their active sites, where they bind and transform their ligand targets. The loops are highly flexible and can create different active-site conformations with distinct properties and functions, such as affinity for different ligands. This enables proteins to carry out more than one function....Meanwhile, far from hindering allostery, it seems likely that structural disorder is a key enabler of it....Many of them (proteins) will bind to all manner of other molecules, including other proteins— they might show some degree of preference for a particular substrate, but not exclusively so. Often a binding event itself gives such proteins a more orderly, folded form: they “fold on binding” into a shape that is contingent on the partner.

,"Changes in gene regulation can be triggered by signals coming from outside the cell’s nucleus, and indeed outside the cell itself: the arrival of a hormone in the bloodstream, say (which might induce a cascade of kinase activity), or developmental signals from surrounding tissues. These messages are conveyed through networks of interacting proteins in the cytoplasm. Likewise, protein networks interpret and respond to the messages coming in the other direction: from the nucleus, in the form of altered expression levels of genes. The “signaling” goes both ways.

There’s some value in that image, but still it’s a metaphor. Life is elsewhere.

,"Yet although they are not highly selective, the various BMPs do have preferences for certain receptors. In 2020 Michael Elowitz and his coworkers set out to understand the rules of this important signaling hub. They began by characterizing the various possible combinations, looking at the binding propensities between ten major mammalian forms of BMPs and seven receptor subunits (all in mouse cells). That meant studying a lot of combinations, but it was made possible with an automated robotic system for carrying out the reactions in cell cultures....The researchers deduced the preferences from the strength of the “output signal”: the activating effect on Smad proteins inside the cells. They engineered the mouse cells so that the Smads would turn on a gene that encodes a yellow fluorescent protein. The output signal for a given set of BMPs and receptor subunits was then gauged from the easily monitored measure of how brightly the cells fluoresced. It was like activating a slot machine by putting a BMP coin (of which there are ten types) and two receptor coins (seven types) into three slots, and seeing what the machines does in response. The interactions, although promiscuous, were far from “anything goes.” There were definite rules about the effects that different BMP/ receptor combinations had. For example, certain BMPs have much the same effect as one another and are interchangeable, while others do not. One BMP plus two receptor subunits might, for example, work as well as an assembly of three entirely different components. Or one assembly might tolerate the swapping of one specific BMP for another, so long as the receptor stays the same. Sometimes two swapped components might have independent effects, so that their combined effect is a simple sum. Sometimes, in contrast, the effects might mutually reinforce each other, or cancel out. In general the BMPs could be grouped according to whether they will have the same effect in a given context, such as a certain cell type. The researchers looked at two types of cell: epithelial (organ lining) cells from mouse mammary glands, and mouse embryonic stem cells. They found that, say, a pair of BMPs might substitute for each other in one type of cell but not in another. It’s a little like the way you can substitute the word for and still retain the same right correct meaning in the context of the sentence “That’s the right answer,” but not “That’s my right hand.” This would explain why the biological effect of a given BMP has been seen previously to differ in different tissues. For example, the protein denoted BMP9 can substitute for BMP10 in the BMP pathway that leads to formation of blood vessel networks, but not in the pathway involved in heart development....Such context dependence is hard to reconcile with the idea that molecular communication depends on highly selective recognition and binding processes— in which case, either you have the right match or you don’t....Why does BMP signaling work in this apparently complicated way, in which the signal can use many different inputs, sometimes interchangeably and sometimes not? Elowitz’s team thinks that the answer is that it gives you more for less. If there’s only one way a given component (such as a BMP) can work— if you have to give it the right pair of receptor subunits or else it does nothing— then there are only a few combinations of the elements that will function. But if element is equivalent, there’s no control— you’re always likely every to have some components that will work, so it might be impossible to turn the signal down or off. With a combinatorial system you have many more options that will do the job, while retaining distinctions of use and meaning. It’s a little like the way languages work: there’s nearly always more than one combination of words that will convey much the same meaning, but those combinations aren’t arbitrary. In many particular contexts, some choices work better— convey a clearer or more emphatic meaning— than others. One advantage of such combinatorial diversity of outputs is that it allows the molecules to convey distinct messages to a wider variety of cell types— and so, in a developing tissue, to produce more complex patterning with a small repertoire of signaling molecules. One group of cells in the developing embryo could be assigned to becoming cartilage, say; another group to bone; and others to other fates. The many possible combinations might create some fuzziness in the criteria for whether a cell adopts one fate or another. But the researchers think this might be sharpened by operating in conjunction with other signaling systems— a bit like the way the meaning of a sentence can be sharpened by the context created by others that precede and follow it....In particular, a pathway involving the Wnt family of proteins is similarly central to early development, and seems often to operate alongside BMP signaling. Sometimes the pathways antagonize one another (for example, Wnt proteins suppress the effects of BMPs); sometimes they enhance each other. The Wnt pathway might follow similar combinatorial rules, although that’s yet to be tested experimentally...",un-dogma,Gene expression,gen_X,BMP3,Protein,Phenotype,Signaling Network,protein interaction,Gene expression,1

But Capsaspora doesn’t have remote enhancers, suggesting that perhaps these were what enabled organisms to progress beyond loose collaborations of autonomous cells to become permanent multicellular assemblies. The regulatory promoter sites in Capsaspora tend to be close to the respective genes, and only a few proteins congregate in the regulatory complexes, in contrast to the rich variety of proteins and other molecules that turn up (perhaps as liquid-like condensates) in the clusters involved in our own regulatory processes.

This isn’t to suggest that all the cognitive differences between humans and other great apes are created by this difference in the timing of a change in cell shape.

An excess of the former biases the switch toward the “erythroid” state, while more PU.1 sends it toward the white blood cell types (the “myeloid” state). But what determines that balance? It’s complicated. For one thing, both proteins are, as you might put it, self- promoting: each can bind to the promoter site of its own gene and boost its expression. The more you have, the more you get. But at the same time, each of the proteins can inhibit the production of the other, like a pair of highly competitive egotists. So there are sensitive feedbacks in this system, and it’s not at all obvious which way it will go.",un-dogma,Cell and organism,cell_org,WA3,Protein,Transcription,Signaling Network,Cell State,Cell and organism,1
,"In effect, then, cells decide on their fate according to their location in three types of space. First, they occupy our familiar three-dimensional space, having specific locations in the tissues of the embryo that determine which neighbors a cell has and what signals it receives. Then there is a location in the gene expression or transcription space, which reflects what kind of cell it is: how stem-like, say, or how mesoderm-like. And the developmental trajectory that the cell lineage takes depends on where it is in the “decision space” of valleys and bifurcations.",un-dogma,Cell and organism,cell_org,SCA1,Transcription,Phenotype,Cell State,Gene Regulation,Cell and organism,1

,"They have shown that oscillatory changes in the expression levels of the Yamanaka factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 are crucial for keeping cells in the pluripotent state and preventing the epigenetic changes that cause differentiation. Differentiated cells lose these oscillations— but reprogramming restores them. The researchers showed that the oscillating state is an attractor defined by this handful of genes, within a genome containing many thousands.....For example, most sea urchins attain their adult form via a larval stage called the pluteus. But some species grow to adult form straight from an egg instead. These species have apparently shed the need for the intermediate stage back in their evolutionary past, by changing the expression pattern of a regulatory gene called that, in arthropods and vertebrates, is Otx involved in creating the anterior- posterior axis of the embryo.

In this way, tissues and organs can feel their own size.

The trick it must master is then to ensure that, in normal circumstances, the system converges on the outcome(s) favored by natural selection, while still maintaining enough phenotypic evolvable.

,"The specialization of some of these cells into different types of neural progenitor cells is influenced by a gradient of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) coming from the notochord. But this produces a rather “noisy” fate- determining signal because of fluctuations in concentration from place to place. As a result, the neural tube does not acquire neatly divided patches of different cell types, but only a rather crudely defined mosaic, with some cells out of place. Sean Megason, Tony Tsai, and their coworkers have shown that a part of the distinctions among these cells created by the SHH signal is that they have different types of adhesion proteins on their surface, and so the different cell types stick to one another with different strengths. As a result, they sort themselves into patches in which their relative mechanically stickiness is well matched. In other words, these differences of cell adhesion correct the errors that result from the noisiness of the SHH signal, generating sharp boundaries between well- sorted cells.",un-dogma,Cell and organism,cell_org,WA4,Environment ,Phenotype,Signaling Network,Development and disease,Cell and organism,1
,"But there’s another oddity associated with Kartagener’s syndrome: around half of people who have it also have a total reversal of the left-right asymmetry of their internal organs, a condition called situs inversus totalis, which can create problems of its own. It is as if, for these people with nonfunctioning cilia, the usual apportioning of organs to the right or left has become totally random, so that there’s a fifty/fifty chance of either. This suggests that the cilia are also somehow involved at the early stage of embryogenesis when left-right asymmetry is established. We now know that at this point the beating cilia create flow patterns in the fluid of the yolk sac. Each acts like a little whisk that stirs the fluid into a vortex. Because of the way the cilia are oriented at the endoderm surface, the net flow goes from right to left at the anterior end of the tissue, and—but more slowly—left to right at the posterior end. In other words, by rotating in a certain direction, the cilia themselves break the left-right symmetry of the embryo, producing a fluid flow that happens in a preferred direction. The positioning of our organs on the correct side is controlled by stirring!",un-dogma,Gene expression,gen_X,SIT1 ,Environment ,Phenotype,Signaling Network,Development and disease,Gene expression,1
,"How, though, does a preferential fluid flow in the liquid outside the embryonic tissue itself get transformed into differences in development? By itself, this directional flow creates a very weak signal for the cells at the surface of the embryo. But the interactions of Nodal and Lefty amplify it—and they do so by a Turing process. Nodal regulates its own expression: it is autocatalytic and can serve as an activator. But Lefty inhibits its expression—and what’s more, the Lefty protein diffuses faster than its Nodal counterpart, as required by the activator-inhibitor scheme. Left to their own devices, Nodal and Lefty create a kind of Turing pattern that is barely a pattern at all: they divide the embryo into two, with one half having relatively high Nodal concentration and the other high Lefty concentration.",un-dogma,Gene expression,gen_X,SIT2,Protein,Phenotype,Signaling Network,Gene Regulation,Gene expression,1

,"But that still doesn’t mean SRY is either necessary or sufficient for a male phenotype. At least two other key genes are known to be involved: our old friend Sox9, and a gene called SF1 that encodes the protein steroidogenic factor 1. The real work of sex determination is, it seems, done by Sox9, expression of which is boosted by the SRY protein, along with SF1, the protein product of which binds to an enhancer region of Sox9. (Actually it’s even more complicated than that, for Sox9 also activates itself in autocatalytic fashion.) So changes in the expression of Sox9 caused by other factors than SRY can, if they happen in the right place at the right time, direct development toward testis formation. Mutations that affect the regulation of Sox9 in some XX people (who obviously lack SRY altogether)—such as mere duplications of Sox9 in the genome—can produce a male phenotype, albeit often with some developmental problems such as learning disabilities.",un-dogma,Mutation,Mut,Mut4,DNA,Phenotype,Gene regulation,Development and disease,DNA,2

,"Among the many varied roles that the Wnt protein family plays in development, some of the most dramatic are to be seen in butterflies, where the wing markings of the Nymphalidae (the largest butterfly family) are controlled by the WntA gene. The gene itself varies little between species; what really matters, it seems, are the regulatory elements associated with it, which are switched by the binding of transcription factors. There are many such regulatory elements linked to just this single gene, and some of these are strongly conserved between different species: they seem to underpin the so- called nymphalid ground plan, the basic coloration design on which the wing patterns of many different species are based. But even though butterflies of the genus Heliconius share several of these conserved regulatory elements, they have others that are species- specific, and these seem responsible for the differences in markings between different species. In other words, the wing pattern looks to be the reliable product of a gene regulatory toolkit that many related species share— but it takes only a small loss or gain of some regulatory element to induce a rather sudden and profound phenotypic shift. It seems likely that the same picture applies not just to this literally superficial (albeit adaptively important) aspect of marking patterns but also to changes in the body plans and shapes of animals. In cases like these, focusing on genetic differences between species offers a very thin view of what is really going on— because the real constructive work of development is being done by a shared toolkit, which generates a palette of possible outcomes. Little regulatory tweaks may tip the balance, but they don’t in any real sense encode the outcome themselves. And they are probably not unique either. We saw a similar phenomenon earlier in the way the morphogenetic patterning process that generates a fin may be readily redirected to make an arm. As with the butterfly patterns, such switches can be abrupt, with no intermediate forms, in contrast to the gradualist picture of conventional Darwinian evolution, where change arises from the slow accumulation of tiny effects due to mutation and selection. Rapid phenotypic change is possible precisely because so little is demanded of the genes themselves.",un-dogma,Protein,Prot,MP2,Protein,Phenotype,Signaling Network,Gene Regulation,Protein,1
